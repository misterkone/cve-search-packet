cve-search-packet
=================

cve-search is a tool to import CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) into a MongoDB to facilitate search and processing of CVEs.

The main objective of the software is to avoid doing direct and public lookup into the public CVE databases.

This is usually faster to do local lookups and limits your sensitive queries via the Internet.

It's a program (cve-search-packet) which permits us to uncover vulnerabilities with pcap file in using cve-search.

I explain:

The first thing to do is to collect network traffic with some software such wireshark and so on...

Secondly, my program will take this capture in argument, it will search in this capture http variable "user-agent" and make 

a search in cve-search in order to see if the version of this user-agent is present in the database and if it's a case

the program will print the ip adress of the computer on which the browser is installed and conclude that this computer

is vulnerable.


I will give you more explanation on the project later
